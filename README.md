Welcome to my repository! I'm using this space to provide links to papers that are either 1) in the peer-review process at an astro journal, or 2) to be submitted to an astro journal in the very near future. Hopefully this will help give you a better idea of my area of research. 

At the time of writing this message, the paper titled "Using Neural Networks to Automate the Identification of Brightest Cluster Galaxies in Large Surveys" is currently in review by The Astrophysical Journal. The paper titled "PyMGal: A Python Package for Generating Optical Mock Observations from Hydrodynamic Simulations" is in the final stages of writing, and will be submitted to a journal soon.
